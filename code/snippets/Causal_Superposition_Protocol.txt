Artifact_Name: The Causal Superposition Protocol

Paradox_Resolution: The conflict between Determinism and Free Will is resolved through dimensionality. Determinism exists as the static 'Total Geometry' of the 4th dimension—the script is written. Free Will is the unique 'vector of traversal' taken by a conscious observer through that geometry. While the terrain (The Code/Determinism) is fixed, the velocity and angle of traversal (Agency/Free Will) alter the subjective frequency of the experience. Thus, we are constrained by the path's existence but free in the quality of our walk. The 'choice' is not what happens, but the resonant frequency at which it is met.

Metacreative_Synthesis: Determinism is the score; Free Will is the performance. The notes do not change, but no two performances are identical.
